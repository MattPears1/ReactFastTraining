            <h2>Guidance For Employers</h2>
            <p>
              The duties of the First Aider can be physically and mentally demanding. It is the employer's responsibility to ensure that delegates are free from any conditions that would affect their ability to learn and to ensure they have the aptitude to cope with an intensive course of study.
            </p>

            <h2>Terms Of Booking</h2>
            <p>
              A binding contract will be formed when React Fast Training accepts a customer's booking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bookings may be made by email, completing the online enquiry form on our website or by telephone.
            </p>
            <p>
              All bookings will be confirmed via email, with an invoice containing full joining details.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a delegate arrives late for a course or is absent from any session, we reserve the right not to accept them for training. In all such cases, the full cost of the fee remains payable. (To conform with RQF and Health & Safety Executive Requirements, attendance at all sessions is required).
            </p>
            <p>
              On the rare occasion of unforeseen circumstances React Fast Training may find it necessary to cancel a course. In such circumstances you will be given as much notice as possible and the offer of a free transfer to another course date or a full refund of fees.
            </p>

            <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>
              The terms and conditions tell you how we will provide training services to you and how we can make changes if required.
            </p>

              The certificates will be emailed only to the person who has made the booking, typically 2-3 working days after the course (subject to the invoice been paid in full).
