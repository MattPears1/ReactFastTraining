# Dashboard Charts Upgrade Summary

const gradient = createGradient(ctx, chart.height, '#10B981', [0.3, 0]);
const barGradient = createGradient(ctx, chart.height, '#0EA5E9', [0.9, 0.6]);

// Chart configuration
{

  backgroundColor: barGradient,
  borderRadius: 6,
  yAxisID: 'y',
},
{
  type: 'line',

```

## Course Duration Fixes

4. Seed data files - Updated for consistency

### Individual Course Pages:

## Dashboard Venue Fix

### Issue:
Dashboard was showing "Leeds City Centre Training Venue" instead of generic locations.

### Solution:
Modified the backend endpoint in start-server.js to use inline mock data generation:

```javascript
upcomingSchedules: (() => {
  const courses = [
    'Emergency First Aid at Work',
    'Paediatric First Aid', 
    'First Aid at Work',
    'Emergency Paediatric First Aid',
    'Oxygen Therapy'
  ];
  
  const venues = [
    'Location 1 - To be announced',
    'Location 2 - To be announced',  
    'Location 3 - To be announced',
    'Location 4 - To be announced'
  ];
  
  // Generate varied schedules with different courses and venues
})()
```

### Result:
- Dashboard now shows varied courses (not repeated)
- Generic locations ("Location X - To be announced")
- Different times and dates
- No specific venue addresses

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Dependencies Added:
```json
{
  "chart.js": "^4.x",
  "react-chartjs-2": "^5.x"
}
```

### CSS Animations:
```css
.chart-fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.8s ease-in-out;
}

.chart-wrapper {
  position: relative;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations:
- Lazy gradient creation on chart mount
- Memoized chart configurations
- Conditional rendering for empty states
- Efficient re-renders using React hooks
