# TODO: Venue Details Confirmation Required

## Action Required
**MUST CONFIRM WITH CLIENT (Lex) - Website Owner**

### Current Status

### What Needs Confirmation
1. **Actual Training Venues**
   - Specific venue names and addresses
   - Which venues are used for which courses
   - Venue capacity and facilities

2. **Venue Information Display**
   - How much detail to show on website vs booking confirmation
   - Whether to list specific venues publicly
   - Accessibility information for each venue

3. **Booking Process**
   - How venue assignment works (automatic vs manual)
   - Whether customers can choose preferred venue
   - How venue changes are handled

### Priority
