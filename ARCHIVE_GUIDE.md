## Archival Process

1. Create archive directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p archive/completed-tasks
   mkdir -p archive/deployment-docs
   mkdir -p archive/old-plans
   mkdir -p archive/reference
   ```

2. Move files with git:
   ```bash
   git mv [file] archive/[category]/[file]
   ```

3. Update any references in active documents

4. Commit with clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Archive completed documentation - July 2025"
   ```

## Summary

By archiving these documents, the project root will be cleaner and focus on:
- Current implementation status
- Critical guidelines and restrictions
- Active development tasks
- Essential reference materials

This will make it easier to find relevant information while preserving historical documentation for reference.
