  Trainer Qualifications
To deliver accredited first aid training in the UK, instructors must meet specific requirements set by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and other regulatory bodies.[1] This ensures a high standard of teaching and competence.
Core Requirements for a First Aid Trainer:
A Valid First Aid Qualification: At a minimum, a trainer must hold a current Level 3 Award in First Aid at Work (FAW).[2][3] For those teaching specialised courses like paediatric first aid, they must also hold the relevant Level 3 Paediatric First Aid qualification.[2]
A Teaching and Assessing Qualification: A recognised teaching qualification is essential. The most common is the Level 3 Award in Education and Training (AET).[2][3] This course, typically completed over three to five days, equips the trainer with the necessary skills to teach effectively.[2][3]
Experience: Trainers are expected to have relevant experience in first aid, which can come from a background in nursing, emergency medicine, or the military.[1] They must also stay up-to-date with the latest treatment protocols and first aid equipment.[1]
Insurance: First aid trainers are required to have public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance to cover them in case of accidents or teaching errors.[3]
