Subject: DNS Setup Instructions for reactfasttraining.co.uk - Ready to Go!

Hi Lex,

The new React Fast Training website is ready to go live on your .co.uk domain. 

I've attached a Word document with simple step-by-step instructions to update your DNS settings in Wix. The whole process should take about 10 minutes.

KEY INFORMATION:
- Your new site is already live at: https://reactfasttraining.org (so you can see what it looks like)
- DNS Target for Wix: react-fast-training-6fb9e7681eed.herokuapp.com
- Your email will NOT be affected

WHAT YOU'LL DO:
1. Log into Wix
2. Delete old A records
3. Add a CNAME record for www
4. Add a redirect for the root domain
5. Save changes

The site will be live at reactfasttraining.co.uk within 1-4 hours after you make the changes.

Please open the attached Word document "LEX_DNS_SETUP_COMPLETE.docx" for the complete instructions with all the details you need to copy and paste.

Let me know when you're ready to make the change, and I'll be available if you need any help.

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. Remember - this is completely reversible if needed. You can always switch back to Wix by changing the DNS settings back.
