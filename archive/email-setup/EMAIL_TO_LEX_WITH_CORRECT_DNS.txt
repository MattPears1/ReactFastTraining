Subject: DNS Setup Instructions for reactfasttraining.co.uk - Ready with Correct DNS Targets!

Hi Lex,

I apologize for the confusion earlier. I now have the CORRECT DNS targets from Heroku for your .co.uk domain.

I've attached a Word document with the exact DNS settings you need to enter in Wix.

KEY DNS TARGETS YOU NEED:
- For www.reactfasttraining.co.uk: clean-bitterroot-cso5qffmswm61g3re2y57u4u.herokudns.com
- For reactfasttraining.co.uk: polished-blueberry-xcvfwormhclqwt1nouztksie.herokudns.com

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use the herokuapp.com address - use these specific herokudns.com targets.

WHAT YOU'LL DO:
1. Log into Wix
2. Delete old A records
3. Add a CNAME record for www (using the DNS target above)
4. Add an ALIAS record for root domain (or use redirect if ALIAS not available)
5. Save changes

The site will be live at reactfasttraining.co.uk within 1-4 hours after you make the changes.

Please open the attached Word document "LEX_DNS_SETUP_FINAL_CORRECT.docx" for complete step-by-step instructions.

The site is already working at https://reactfasttraining.org so you can see what it will look like.

Let me know if you need any help!

Best regards,
[Your name]
