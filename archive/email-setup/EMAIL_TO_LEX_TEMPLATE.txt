Subject: DNS Setup Instructions for reactfasttraining.co.uk

Hi Lex,

The new React Fast Training website is ready to go live. To point your domain from Wix to the new site, I need you to update the DNS settings.

I've prepared step-by-step instructions that should take about 10-15 minutes to complete.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
- Heroku App URL: react-fast-training-6fb9e7681eed.herokuapp.com
- Current working example: https://reactfasttraining.org
- DNS Target: Use the herokuapp.com URL above for both www and root domain

WHAT WILL HAPPEN:
- Your domain will point to the new site instead of Wix
- Email services will NOT be affected
- The change takes 1-4 hours to fully complete
- The old Wix site will still exist but won't be accessible via the domain

ATTACHED INSTRUCTIONS:
Please see the attached "DNS_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_LEX.md" file for detailed steps with screenshots.

TIMING:
- Best to do this when you have 15 minutes free
- Avoid making changes on Friday afternoon (in case support is needed)
- The site may be intermittently available for a few hours after the change

BEFORE YOU START:
Please confirm:
1. You have access to your Wix account
2. You're ready to switch to the new site
3. You understand the old Wix site won't be accessible via the domain

Let me know when you're ready to proceed, and I'll be available to help if you run into any issues.

The new site includes all the features we discussed:
- Online booking system
- Booking inquiry forms
- Automated email confirmations
- Mobile-responsive design
- Fast loading times

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. If you need to revert back to Wix for any reason, you can do so by reversing the DNS changes. I've included those instructions in the document as well.
