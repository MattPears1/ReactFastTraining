---

## Step 3: Configure DNS Records

### Remove/Disable Existing Records
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Before adding new records, you may need to disable or remove existing A records pointing to Wix servers.

1. Look for any existing **A records** with values like:
   - 185.230.63.xxx
   - 185.230.60.xxx
   - Any Wix IP addresses
2. **Delete** or **Disable** these records

### Add New DNS Records

You need to add the following records:

#### For www.reactfasttraining.co.uk:
Add this CNAME record:
```
Type: CNAME
Host/Name: www
Points to: react-fast-training-6fb9e7681eed.herokuapp.com
TTL: 1 hour (or 3600)
```

#### For reactfasttraining.co.uk (root domain):
**Option 1 - If Wix supports ALIAS/ANAME records:**
```
Type: ALIAS (or ANAME)
Host/Name: @ (or leave empty)
Points to: react-fast-training-6fb9e7681eed.herokuapp.com
TTL: 1 hour (or 3600)
```

**Option 2 - If Wix only supports URL forwarding for root:**
```
Type: URL Redirect (or Forwarding)
Host/Name: @ (or leave empty)
Destination: https://www.reactfasttraining.co.uk
Redirect Type: 301 (Permanent)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The exact DNS target for your domain will be provided when the .co.uk domain is fully configured in Heroku. It may be different from the above.

### Keep These Records
‚úÖ Keep any **MX records** (for email)
‚úÖ Keep any **TXT records** (for email verification, etc.)

---

## Step 4: Save Changes

1. Click **"Save"** or **"Save DNS Records"**
2. You may see a warning about the site not being hosted on Wix - this is normal, click **"Yes, Continue"**

---

## Step 5: What Happens Next

### DNS Propagation
- Changes can take 1-48 hours to fully propagate worldwide
- Most users will see the change within 1-4 hours
- Your site may be intermittently available during this time

### Testing
After 1-2 hours, test by visiting:
- https://reactfasttraining.co.uk
- https://www.reactfasttraining.co.uk

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Email Services**: These changes should NOT affect your email if you keep MX records intact
2. **SSL Certificate**: The new site will automatically get an SSL certificate from Heroku
3. **Old Wix Site**: Your Wix site will still exist but won't be accessible via this domain
4. **Reverting**: You can always revert by re-adding the original Wix DNS records

---

## üö® If Something Goes Wrong

If the site doesn't work after 24 hours:
1. Double-check all DNS records are entered correctly
2. Ensure old A records are removed
3. Clear your browser cache and try again
4. Try accessing from a different device/network
