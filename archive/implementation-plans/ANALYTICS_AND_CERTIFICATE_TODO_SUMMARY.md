# Analytics & Certificate System - Implementation Summary

**Last Updated: 28th July 2025 - 00:00**

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Analytics System
1. **Database Structure**
   - Created `course_analytics` table for aggregated metrics
   - Created `visitor_analytics` table for GDPR-compliant tracking
   - Created `error_logs` table for system monitoring
   - Added database views for easy reporting

2. **Venue Simplification**
   - Reduced from 17 venues to just 3:
     - Location 1 - Sheffield (City Centre)
     - Location 2 - Sheffield (Business District)
     - Location 3 - Yorkshire (TBD)
   - Updated all seed files and API endpoints

3. **Backend Services**
   - `analytics.service.ts` - Course popularity and revenue tracking
   - `visitor-tracking.service.ts` - Anonymous session tracking
   - `error-logging.service.ts` - Enhanced error monitoring

4. **Analytics Features**
   - Course popularity by bookings and revenue
   - Day of week analysis (which days are most popular)
   - Monthly trends analysis
   - Booking funnel (visitors â†’ booking â†’ completion)
   - Revenue by course (NOT by location)

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks (High Priority)

### Certificate System
1. **Booking Form Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   // Add certificate_name field to booking form
   <input 
     name="certificateName"
     placeholder="Name as it should appear on certificate"
     required
   />
   ```

2. **Attendance Workflow**
   - Admin page to mark attendance after course
   - Bulk attendance marking feature
   - Trigger certificate generation on confirmation

3. **Certificate Generation**
   - Implement PDF generation (Puppeteer)
   - Use HTML templates from database
   - Generate unique certificate numbers
   - Store PDFs locally (no cloud storage)

4. **Automatic Emails**
   - Send certificate after attendance confirmation
   - Thank you message template
   - PDF attachment included

### Analytics UI Components
1. **Admin Dashboard Pages**
   - `/admin/analytics` - Main analytics dashboard
   - Course popularity widgets
   - Revenue charts by course
   - Day/month heatmaps
   - Booking funnel visualization

2. **Frontend Tracking**
   - Add tracking script to public pages
   - Track page views (anonymous)
   - Track booking journey stages
   - Respect Do Not Track headers

## ðŸš€ Implementation Order

### Week 1 (Immediate)
- [ ] Add certificate_name to booking form
- [ ] Create admin analytics dashboard page
- [ ] Implement basic course popularity display

### Week 2 
- [ ] Build attendance confirmation page
- [ ] Set up PDF generation for certificates
- [ ] Create certificate email templates

### Week 3
- [ ] Add visitor tracking to frontend
- [ ] Implement booking funnel tracking
- [ ] Create revenue charts

### Week 4
- [ ] Testing and refinements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation

## ðŸ’¡ Key Implementation Notes

### Certificate Names
- Users enter name during booking
- Clear warning: "Enter name EXACTLY as you want on certificate"
- Cannot be changed after booking
- Prevents issues with nicknames vs formal names

### Analytics Privacy
- NO personal data in visitor tracking
- Anonymous session IDs only
- Auto-delete after 90 days
- No IP logging

### Revenue Tracking
- By course type only (NOT location)
- Locations are just operational details
- Focus on which courses generate most revenue

### Error Monitoring
- Categorized by type (booking, payment, auth, system)
- Critical errors trigger alerts
- Resolution tracking built-in

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

1. **Certificates**
   - 100% accuracy on names
   - < 5 seconds generation time
   - Automatic email within 1 minute

2. **Analytics**
   - Real-time course popularity
   - Accurate revenue tracking

3. **System Health**
   - < 0.1% error rate
   - All errors logged and categorized
   - Quick error resolution
