## My Recommendation

Start simple with 3-5 most useful downloads:

2. First Aid Kit Checklist  
3. Emergency Numbers Card
4. Pre-Course Information Pack
5. Certificate Renewal Timeline

These provide immediate value and aren't too time-consuming to create.

## Alternative: Remove Downloads Page
If creating content seems like too much work initially, you could:
- Remove the Downloads link from navigation
- Add it later when you have content ready
- Focus on core business first
