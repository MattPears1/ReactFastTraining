# Payment & Invoice System Integration

## Overview
The booking system has been enhanced with comprehensive payment tracking and automated invoice generation features. This document outlines the integration between the original booking system and the new payment/invoice modules.

## New Database Tables

### 1. **payments** Table
- Tracks all payment records with Stripe integration
- Links to bookings via `booking_id`
- Stores payment method details, amounts, and status
- Includes Stripe payment intent and charge IDs

### 2. **payment_logs** Table
- Audit trail for all payment-related events
- Tracks IP addresses and user agents
- Stores event data in JSONB format

### 3. **refunds** Table
- Manages refund requests and processing
- Approval workflow with `requested_by` and `approved_by`
- Links to both bookings and payments

### 4. **invoices** Table
- Stores invoice records with unique numbering
- Links to bookings, users, and payments
- Tracks PDF generation and email sending

### 5. **webhook_events** Table
- Stores all incoming Stripe webhook events
- Handles event processing and retries
- Prevents duplicate processing

## Integration Flow

### 1. Booking Creation
```
User → BookingWizard → BookingService.createBooking()
  → Creates booking record
  → Creates payment intent via PaymentService
  → Returns client secret to frontend
```

### 2. Payment Processing
```
User → PaymentStep → Stripe.confirmCardPayment()
  → Stripe processes payment
  → Webhook received → webhook_events table
  → PaymentService creates payment record
  → BookingService.confirmBooking() called
```

### 3. Booking Confirmation
```
BookingService.confirmBooking()
  → Updates booking status to CONFIRMED
  → Creates payment record in payments table
  → InvoiceService.createInvoice() called
  → Generates invoice number (INV-YYYY-00001 format)
  → Creates invoice record
  → Generates PDF via InvoicePDFGenerator
  → Stores PDF via StorageService
  → Sends invoice email
  → Original booking confirmation email sent
```

### 4. Refund Process
```
User requests refund → RefundService
  → Creates refund record (status: pending)
  → Admin approves refund
  → Stripe API processes refund
  → Updates refund status
  → Updates invoice status if needed
  → Sends refund confirmation email
```

## Key Integration Points

### BookingService Enhancement
The `confirmBooking` method now includes:
```typescript
// Generate invoice if payment exists
if (payment && payment.status === 'succeeded') {
  try {
    await InvoiceService.createInvoice(bookingId);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Invoice generation failed:', error);
    // Don't fail the booking confirmation if invoice fails
  }
}
```

### Payment Event Tracking
All payment events are logged:
- payment.created
- payment.succeeded
- payment.failed
- refund.requested
- refund.processed
- invoice.generated

### Invoice Features
- Automatic sequential numbering
- PDF generation with professional layout
- Email delivery with PDF attachment
- Storage service integration
- VAT/tax support (currently set to 0)

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Invoice generation failures don't block booking confirmation
- PDF generation failures are logged but don't stop the process
- Email sending failures are handled separately

### Webhook Reliability
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate charges
- Webhook events are stored and processed asynchronously
- Retry mechanism for failed webhook processing

## Security Enhancements

### Payment Security
- No card details stored in database
- Stripe handles all sensitive payment data
- Payment logs track all activities
- IP addresses and user agents recorded

### Invoice Security
- Unique invoice numbers prevent guessing
- PDFs stored securely with access controls
- Invoice access linked to user authentication

## Testing Considerations

### Payment Testing
- Use Stripe test cards for different scenarios
- Test successful payments: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Test 3D Secure: 4000 0027 6000 3184
- Test failures: 4000 0000 0000 0002

### Invoice Testing
- Verify PDF generation
- Check email delivery
- Test invoice numbering sequence
- Verify storage service integration

### Refund Testing
- Test partial refunds
- Test full refunds
- Verify approval workflow
- Check status updates

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics
- Payment success rate
- Invoice generation time
- PDF storage usage
- Email delivery rate
- Webhook processing time

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor webhook event queue
- Check for stuck payments
- Verify invoice number sequence
- Clean up old webhook events

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **VAT/Tax Support**
   - Add configurable tax rates
   - Support for different tax regions
   - Tax calculation on invoices

2. **Multi-currency Support**
   - Handle different currencies
   - Currency conversion tracking

3. **Subscription Payments**
   - Recurring payment support
   - Subscription management

4. **Advanced Reporting**
   - Payment analytics dashboard
   - Revenue reporting
   - Refund analytics

5. **Payment Methods**
   - Support for bank transfers
   - Direct debit integration
   - PayPal integration

## API Endpoints

### New Payment Endpoints
- `POST /api/payments/webhook` - Stripe webhook handler
- `GET /api/payments/:id` - Get payment details
- `GET /api/bookings/:id/payment` - Get booking payment

### New Invoice Endpoints
- `GET /api/invoices/:id` - Get invoice details
- `GET /api/invoices/:id/download` - Download invoice PDF
- `POST /api/invoices/:id/resend` - Resend invoice email

### New Refund Endpoints
- `POST /api/refunds` - Request refund
- `PUT /api/refunds/:id/approve` - Approve refund
- `GET /api/refunds/:id/status` - Check refund status

## Conclusion

The payment and invoice system seamlessly integrates with the booking system, providing:
- Complete payment tracking and audit trails
- Professional invoice generation
- Automated email notifications
- Comprehensive refund management
- Webhook-based real-time updates

This enhancement makes the booking system production-ready with enterprise-level payment handling capabilities.
