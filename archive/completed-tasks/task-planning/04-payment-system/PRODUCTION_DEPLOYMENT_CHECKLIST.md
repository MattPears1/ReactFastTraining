## Deployment Process

### üì¶ Pre-Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Create deployment branch from tested code
2. [ ] Run full test suite
3. [ ] Update version numbers
4. [ ] Generate deployment artifacts
5. [ ] Review security scan results
6. [ ] Backup current production data

### üöÄ Deployment Steps
1. [ ] **Database Migration**
   - [ ] Backup production database
   - [ ] Run migration scripts
   - [ ] Verify migration success
   - [ ] Create rollback plan

2. [ ] **Application Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
   - [ ] Run smoke tests on staging
   - [ ] Deploy to production (blue-green if possible)
   - [ ] Verify health checks pass
   - [ ] Monitor error rates

3. [ ] **Configuration Updates**
   - [ ] Update environment variables
   - [ ] Configure webhook endpoints in Stripe
   - [ ] Update DNS/Load balancer settings
   - [ ] Configure SSL certificates
   - [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

### ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification
1. [ ] **Functional Verification**
   - [ ] Make test payment (small amount)
   - [ ] Verify payment appears in Stripe
   - [ ] Check database records created
   - [ ] Verify email notifications sent
   - [ ] Test refund process
   - [ ] Generate test invoice

2. [ ] **Monitoring Verification**
   - [ ] Logs are being collected
   - [ ] Metrics are being recorded
   - [ ] Alerts are functional
   - [ ] Dashboards show data
   - [ ] No unexpected errors

3. [ ] **Performance Verification**
   - [ ] Response times are normal
