```

## Testing the Implementation

### To verify the fix works:
1. Navigate to the admin dashboard

4. Should navigate to `/admin/schedule/{id}` without loops

### Available Actions:
- View complete session information
- Edit capacity and basic details
- View and manage attendees
- Track financial performance
- Email attendees
- Export data
