# Security Audit Report - Lex Business Website

**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis System  
**Scope:** Full stack application security review

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The application shows good implementation of some security practices but lacks critical protections against CSRF attacks and has concerning hardcoded secrets in environment files.

### Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)
- **No CSRF Protection** - Application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
- **Hardcoded JWT Secret** - Development secret exposed in .env file
- **Weak JWT Secret** - Using predictable development secret in production risk

### High-Severity Issues
- **Stack Traces in Production** - Sensitive error details exposed when NODE_ENV != development
- **Missing Security Headers** - Several critical security headers not configured
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - Multiple outdated packages with known vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection Risk** - Raw SQL queries found in analytics module

### Medium-Severity Issues
- **Session Management** - No session invalidation on password change
- **File Upload Risks** - MIME type validation can be bypassed
- **Rate Limiting** - Generic rate limits may not protect all endpoints adequately

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### CRITICAL: Hardcoded JWT Secret
**Location:** `/backend/.env` (line 10)
```
JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-key-for-testing-only
```
**Risk:** This predictable secret can be used to forge authentication tokens
**Recommendation:** Generate cryptographically secure random secret: `openssl rand -base64 64`

#### HIGH: No Token Revocation Mechanism
**Issue:** No implementation for revoking JWT tokens on logout or password change
**Risk:** Compromised tokens remain valid until expiration
**Recommendation:** Implement token blacklisting using Redis

#### MEDIUM: Missing Two-Factor Authentication Implementation
**Issue:** User model has 2FA fields but no implementation found
**Risk:** Reduced account security for high-value targets

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

#### CRITICAL: No CSRF Protection
**Issue:** No CSRF token implementation found in the codebase
**Risk:** All state-changing operations vulnerable to CSRF attacks
**Recommendation:** Implement CSRF protection using `csurf` middleware:
```typescript
import csrf from 'csurf';
const csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true });
app.use(csrfProtection);
```

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

#### HIGH: SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Location:** `/backend/src/services/analytics/analytics.store.ts`
Multiple raw SQL queries using template literals pose injection risk:
```typescript
await this.pool.query(`
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS analytics_events (
    ...
  )`);
```
**Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries exclusively

#### GOOD: Input Validation
- Joi validation middleware properly implemented
- Request body validation with proper sanitization options

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

#### LOW: Limited XSS Risk
**Good Practices Found:**
- React's default XSS protection in place
- Only 2 instances of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` found:
  - SEO component with JSON-LD (safe)
  - ProgressBar styling (potential risk if user-controlled)

#### Recommendation: 
Review `ProgressBar.tsx` line 294 to ensure `stripedStyles` cannot contain user input

### 5. Security Headers

#### HIGH: Missing Security Headers
While `helmet` is implemented, additional headers needed:
```typescript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

### 6. Session Management

#### MEDIUM: Session Security Issues
- No session invalidation on password change
- Missing secure session configuration
- No session timeout implementation

**Recommendation:** Implement proper session management:
```typescript
app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: true, // HTTPS only
    httpOnly: true,
    maxAge: 1800000, // 30 minutes
    sameSite: 'strict'
  }
}));
```

### 7. File Upload Security

#### MEDIUM: File Upload Validation Gaps
**Good:** File validator implements multiple checks
**Issues:**
- MIME type validation can be spoofed
- No virus scanning implementation
- File content not validated against MIME type

**Recommendation:** Implement file content validation using `file-type` package

### 8. Sensitive Data Exposure

#### HIGH: Error Stack Traces in Development Mode
**Location:** `/backend/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` (lines 57-60)
Stack traces exposed when NODE_ENV=development
**Risk:** Information disclosure in staging environments
**Recommendation:** Never expose stack traces to clients

#### GOOD: Password Security
- Bcrypt with salt rounds of 10 (adequate)
- Passwords excluded from default User model queries

### 9. API Security

#### GOOD: Rate Limiting
- General rate limiting implemented (100 requests/15 min)
- Strict rate limiting for auth endpoints (5 requests/15 min)

#### MEDIUM: Missing API Versioning
No API versioning strategy found
**Risk:** Breaking changes affect all clients
**Recommendation:** Implement versioning: `/api/v1/`

### 10. Dependency Vulnerabilities

#### HIGH: Outdated Dependencies
Several packages have known vulnerabilities:
- `moment` (deprecated, use `date-fns` exclusively)
- `axios` - update to latest version
- Multiple packages not updated in months

**Recommendation:** Run `npm audit fix` and update dependencies

### 11. CORS Configuration

#### GOOD: CORS Implementation
- Properly configured with allowed origins
- Credentials support enabled
- Environment-based configuration

### 12. Infrastructure Security

#### MEDIUM: Redis Without Authentication
**Location:** `/backend/.env` (line 24)
```
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```
**Risk:** Unauthorized access to cache data
**Recommendation:** Set strong Redis password
