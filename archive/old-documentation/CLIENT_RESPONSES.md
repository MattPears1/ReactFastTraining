# Responses to Your Questions

## 1. Email System Setup

I've created a detailed guide in `DOMAIN_EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` that explains:

- **Heroku** hosts your website but doesn't provide emails or domains
- **Google Workspace** (£5.20/month) will give you info@reactfasttraining.co.uk
- **Multiple emails** = multiple fees (3 emails = £15.60/month)
- **Money-saving tip**: Use one account with free aliases

## 2. Domain Transfer from Wix

You have two options:
1. **Keep domain at Wix** - Just point it to Heroku (easier)
2. **Transfer to another registrar** - More complex, not necessary

I recommend keeping it at Wix and just updating DNS settings.

## 3. What I Need From You

Either:
- **Option A**: Share Wix login temporarily so I can set it up
- **Option B**: I'll guide you step-by-step via messages

## 4. Contact Page Updates - COMPLETED ✓

All requested changes have been implemented:
- Changed to "South Yorkshire" throughout
- Updated locations to: Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham, Sheffield  
- Changed email to info@reactfasttraining.co.uk everywhere
- Removed times from "Call Us" section
- Updated Saturday hours to 10am-3pm
- Removed map
- Added course dropdown to contact form
- Removed Live Chat, Schedule Call, and Support Ticket sections

## 5. Testimonials Page

My recommendation:
- **Option 1**: Link to Google Reviews (builds trust, less work)
- **Option 2**: Create a page on site (more control, more work)

Most businesses start with Option 1.

## 6. Downloads Page

I've created `DOWNLOADS_PAGE_IDEAS.md` with suggestions:
- First aid quick reference guides
- Course information packs
- Workplace compliance templates
- Emergency posters

Or we can remove this page until you have content ready.

## Next Steps

1. Decide on email setup approach
2. Choose testimonials strategy  
3. Decide on downloads page
4. Provide Wix access or choose guided setup

The website code is ready - we just need to connect your domain and email!
