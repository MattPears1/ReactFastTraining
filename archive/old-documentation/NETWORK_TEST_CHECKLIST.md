# Network Connection Test Checklist

## ‚úÖ Firewall Rule is Active
Your firewall rule "Vite Dev Server" is properly configured and allowing inbound connections on port 3000.

## üîç Test These URLs on Your Phone

Based on your network output, try these in order:

1. **`http://192.168.0.230:3000/`** (Most likely - standard home network)
2. **`http://192.168.0.186:3000/`** (If you mentioned this worked)
3. **`http://172.22.64.1:3000/`** (WSL network - less likely)

## üì± Phone Browser Tips

### For "Connection Not Secure" Warnings:

**Chrome (Android):**
1. When you see the warning, tap the page
2. Tap "Advanced" at the bottom
3. Tap "Proceed to 192.168.0.230 (unsafe)"

**Safari (iPhone):**
1. Tap "Show Details"
2. Tap "Visit this website"
3. Tap "Visit" when prompted

**Firefox (Any):**
- Usually works without warnings for local development

## üß™ Quick Network Test

1. **On your PC**, open Command Prompt and run:
   ```cmd
   ping 192.168.0.186
   ```
   If your phone's IP responds, the network connection is good.

2. **Check if Vite is actually listening:**
   - When you run `npm run dev`, you should see:
   ```
   ‚ûú  Network: http://192.168.0.230:3000/
   ```
   - Use whatever IP is shown there

3. **Try a different port:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 8080
   ```
   Then try: `http://192.168.0.230:8080/`

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "This site can't be reached"
- **Cause**: Wrong IP or network isolation
- **Fix**: Ensure both devices on same WiFi, not guest network

### Issue: "Connection not private/secure"
- **Cause**: HTTPS warning for HTTP site
- **Fix**: Use the "Advanced" option to proceed anyway

### Issue: Page loads but no styles
- **Cause**: Mixed content or CORS issues
- **Fix**: Make sure you're using HTTP (not HTTPS) in the URL

## üí° Alternative Solutions

### 1. Use Your PC's Hostname
Sometimes the hostname works better than IP:
```
http://YOUR-PC-NAME:3000/
```

### 2. Temporarily Disable Windows Defender Firewall
(Just for testing - remember to re-enable!)
1. Windows Security ‚Üí Firewall & network protection
2. Turn off firewall for Private network
3. Test the connection
4. Turn firewall back on

### 3. Use a Tunneling Service
```bash
# Install localtunnel
npm install -g localtunnel

# Run your dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal
lt --port 3000
```
This gives you a public URL that works anywhere.

## üéØ Most Likely Solution

Since your firewall is configured correctly, the issue is probably:
1. Using the wrong IP address - try `192.168.0.230` specifically
2. Browser security warning - use the "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed" option
3. Make sure your phone is on WiFi, not mobile data

The fact that you can see the Vite output with multiple network interfaces means it's broadcasting correctly. You just need to find which IP your phone can reach.
