- Database schema design and migrations
- Authentication system
- Basic admin layout and navigation

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
- Dashboard analytics
- Course management CRUD
- Basic booking views

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- Advanced booking management
- Schedule creation with calendar
- Financial reporting
- Custom analytics tracking

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 7)

- User acceptance testing

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - Secure password requirements (min 8 chars, complexity)
   - Session timeout after inactivity
   - Failed login attempt limiting

2. **Authorization**
   - Admin-only access to all features
   - API endpoint protection
   - CSRF token validation

3. **Data Protection**
   - Input sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
   - XSS protection

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow TypeScript strict mode
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add loading states for all async operations
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness
5. Write unit tests for critical business logic
6. Document all API endpoints

## Getting Started

1. Review individual component documentation in respective folders
2. Set up database using migration files in `/database`
3. Implement authentication first (foundational requirement)
4. Build features incrementally following the phases above
