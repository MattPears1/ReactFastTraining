**Files Created:**
- `/src/utils/colorContrast.ts`

### 6. Focus Management ✅ ENHANCED

- Modal dialogs had incomplete focus trapping
- Route changes didn't reset focus properly

**Improvements Made:**
- Enhanced `useTrapFocus` hook implementation
- Modal component properly manages focus restoration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Heading Hierarchy Review**: Conduct a page-by-page review to ensure proper heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
2. **Testing with Real Users**: Engage users with disabilities for real-world testing
3. **Automated Testing Integration**: Implement axe-core or similar tools in CI/CD pipeline

### Future Enhancements
1. **Language Support**: Add multi-language support with proper language tags
2. **Reduced Motion**: Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
3. **High Contrast Mode**: Add dedicated high contrast theme option
4. **Voice Navigation**: Consider implementing voice command support

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist for ongoing accessibility testing:

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Test dropdown menus with arrow keys
- [ ] Ensure no keyboard traps exist
- [ ] Test modal dialogs and overlays

### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Navigate with screen reader enabled
- [ ] Verify all content is announced properly
- [ ] Check form field descriptions
- [ ] Test dynamic content announcements
- [ ] Verify landmark navigation

### Visual Testing
- [ ] Check color contrast ratios
- [ ] Test with browser zoom at 200%
- [ ] Verify layout at 320px width
- [ ] Disable CSS and check content structure
- [ ] Test with Windows High Contrast mode

### Forms and Errors
- [ ] Submit forms with errors
- [ ] Verify error announcements

## Conclusion

The Lex Business website has been significantly improved to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. The implementation includes robust keyboard navigation, proper ARIA usage, accessible forms, and clear focus management. While most criteria are fully met, continued testing and refinement, particularly around heading hierarchy and real-user testing, will ensure the best possible experience for all users.
